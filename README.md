# Student Marks Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning and standardising a raw student marks dataset using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.  
The goal is to convert an inconsistent and messy CSV file into a clean, analysis-ready dataset that can be used for reporting, dashboards, or further analysis.

---

## Overview

Real-world datasets usually contain errors, duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formats, and invalid entries.  
This project demonstrates how to identify these issues and fix them through a repeatable data-cleaning workflow.

The final cleaned output is saved as a separate CSV file.
